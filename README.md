# GenomeAssembler
We desire to develop an assembler based on De Bruji Graph data strucure using Golang and apply it to short reads to produce contigs of significant length. On top of the genome assembly function, we wish to include the following functions: automatically estimate the best kmer size; Incorporate HiC data into the scaffolding process; assembly visualization.
